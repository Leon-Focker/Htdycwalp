\; In the 'trigger-input' section \; you can set a key or midi input
\; to progress through the cues \; 'reset' resets everything for the
\; beginning of the piece \, also the \; faders. To set that initial
fader \; value \, use 'fader init' \;;
#X text 20 342 To perform the piece you need at least 3 speakers \;
One in or in front of the ensemble \, which 'Center' will be routed
to \; This one should point directly to the audience and sound as clear
as \; possible \; 'Left' and 'Right' should be routed to Loudspeakers
that do not point \; to the audience. For example they can be placed
behind the ensemble \; and sound less direct. The exact mix between
the speakers and between \; direct sound and reverberated sound should
be figuered out in the space \; and by taste \; Check out the recording
